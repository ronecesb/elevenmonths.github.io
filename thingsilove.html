    "i do say it all the time, but i love you so much and always will. even if things seem tough, just know that i'll always be here loving you with every beat of my heart (romantic af right) and that i wont go anywhere",
    "you are so pretty, and i know sometimes you are hard on yourself when it comes to that, but you are seriously so beautiful. i always tell you, but every single one of your features is perfect and pretty to me, and all of you in general.",
    "YOU ARE SO FREAKING TALENTED... never underestimate yourself because i dont know a better artist and writer or anyone with as much creativity, nostalgia, and depth to what they do...",
    "you handle my crazy... and for just that alone i think you deserve praise... you have a crazy gf but you love her and she loves you.... hehe..",
    "i think you have the cutest smile in the world... not only does it put on display your cute little dimples, but you also look so beautiful when you're smiling (and always), ill do my very best to make you smile as much as i can.",
    "no matter what it is, even if its something small, trivial, like deciding what to wear one day, or something weighing a bit more on you, ill always be there to listen with attentive ears. ill always take it seriously, because anything you tell me will always be more important than anything else.",
    "i love your little habits such as when you tend to hum or sing songs on call, or come up with silly nicknames like yn, or look at a blind box's list of options before you see what it is when you feel the bag so you can guess. all of it means so much to me, and i find it so endearing and cute.",
    "i love how your writing feels like a warm hug and that also includes the way you tend to comfort me and talk to me about things, i feel so lucky knowing that when i come to you ill always feel so comforted by the things you say.",
    "i love your voice... i dont say it often but i really love the way you sound and it brings me so much comfort that sometimes i miss it so much that i beg you for a call or voice note just so i can hear you... have you noticed...",
    "i love that i can trust you so much. i talked about this with my friends once, but being with someone that i feel like i can trust with so much of me is something i feel so lucky to be able to experience. its hard for me to put my trust into someone, but with you it feels so easy cause you've never shown me a reason not to.",
    "you always let me talk about my interests no matter how nerdy they are, and always are so attentive, which makes you such a sweet person... cause i know it can get nerdy but you still listen...",
    "you always put so much effort into us and into making me feel loved and it means so much to me",
    "you are so freaking funny.. LIKE ACTUALLY... every time we talk im always doubled over in laugh from something youve said and i appreciate that so much",
    "you always accept me just as i am, and i've never felt like i have to change... because you love me just as i am and i also love you just as you are..",
    "i love that both of us together can turn something silly into something that belongs to us... if that doesnt make sense let me use the sumo wrestler thing as an example... at the end of the day its so silly but it also just will always remind me of us you know.. even if its silly its something that we both find funny and it makes me happy that you do that the way i do",
    "even though this is such a silly thing, and id never let you do it, sometimes it makes me giggle when you say that if i wasnt on earth neither would you, and that youd want to go wherever i am... i think even though its silly, something about that is romantic (we are both crazy)",
    "i think its so cute how shy you get when we call sometimes, even though i love your face and find it the prettiest ever, its so silly and cute when you still get shy to show it on camera... it makes me feel like we both still get nervous around each other, even though we are dating hehe",
    "i love your freaking music taste so much... i do say this a lot but ive learned about so many artists because of you and i find myself wanting to learn even more and more about the songs that mean so much to you...",
    "i find it so cute how you get a little scared when we play scary games together, but somehow you are still so good at them despite never seeing or playing them before.... how do you do it umington...",
    "just need you to know (you already know) but i am your number 1 fan like actually.. like no one is a bigger umi fan and supporter than me... and i always always will be... i love you so much...",
    "we will be together forever, and i'd always wait for you, no matter how long it takes or for what... i just want you to feel safe in that i will always love you and do whatever it takes to make you happy... i am so secure in us and even though you are my first in so many ways, you will also be my last, cause i want to spend the rest of time with you",
    "i admire how strong you are. without a doubt it would be undermining how tough the past few months have been if i were to just use the word 'tough' yet you still make it an effort to talk to me, to go back to work, to help out your family... i hope all the hard work and effort you put out into the world comes right back to you in the form of happiness and good things because you deserve it, and you deserve to get everything you ever wanted and I WILL HELP IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.",
    "you always inspire me to improve myself. ever since we met, i felt as though i wanted to work more on myself to be a good gf for you, and its something i feel like i would've have even worked on if i hadnt met you... i always want to impress you and also be as healthy as possible for you, and ive seen myself improving and its all thanks to you... hehe...",
    "talking to you is so easy. i remember the first time we talked i was so nervous that i wouldn't know how to talk to you or how to keep a conversation going, but i remember we talked for so long and it felt so natural. there wasnt a single moment that felt empty and uncomfortable and it has always been like that with you. every time we call, we are able to talk about anything and everything and i appreciate that so much. talking to you has always been easy but especially because you always make me feel safe.",
    "you are so encouraging. although you are often so hard on yourself, you always encourage me and compliment the things i do. i know there are a lot of things i am learning or not great at, but you always make me feel like thats okay and that im doing great regardless. i want to always make you feel that way too, so i hope you know i am always so proud of you and impressed by you.",
    "i think everything about you is cute and i love all of it. every day i grow to love everything i learn about you even more and the more i learn about you the happier i get too. i love learning things about you and when you tell me new things and i never want to stop.",

(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶) .ᐟ.ᐟ i made you a little website with my (lack of) computer science knowledge... you liked the other one a lot but that one wasnt my own website that i made, it was a cute little website though... BUT THIS ONE IS MY OWN THAT I WORKED HARD TO CODE AND DESIGN TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY.. its one that no one else but you can access so its even more special... i also drew everything on this page hehe besides the text of course... cute tone.. so please love it so much but to actually use it you have to answer some REALLY hard questions (im lying i just wanted to make this more interactive)... <br>the first one is...</br><br>what day did we start talking?</b></p></br>
